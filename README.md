Pluggable prerendering stack for ahead-of-time data fetching and embedding in Product Pages and framework for definining rendering templates and rules.

* ⚡️ Boost SEO by pre-rendering human-readable product data in the markup
* 💉 Inject JSON-LD Structured data in the page source code
* 📈 Aggregate data sources and inject resulting data ahead-of-time
* ⚙️ Define your custom rendering logic
* 🧠 Offload intensive computation to the rendering phase

## Getting started

  Setup of prerequisites and Edge Delivery Services is guided and some steps are automated.

  1. Go to [https://developer.adobe.com/console](https://developer.adobe.com/console) and choose "Create project from template"
  1. Select "App Builder" and choose the environments (workspaces) according to your needs (we recommend Stage and Production as a starting point)
  1. You can leave all the other fields as per default settings; don't forget to provide a descriptive project title.
  1. After saving the newly created project, click on the workspace you want to deploy the prerendering stack to, and from the top-right click "Download All": this will download a JSON file that will be used in the setup process.
  1. Then generate a repo with the relevant code in your org by clicking [here](https://github.com/new?template_name=aem-commerce-prerender&template_owner=adobe-rnd). You can now clone the resulting repo from your org, and run `npm i && npx setup`
  1. Follow the steps to perform the initial setup
  1. Customise the code that contains the rendering logic according to your requirements, for [structured data](/actions/pdp-renderer/ldJson.js), [markup](/actions/pdp-renderer/render.js) and [templates](https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-commerce-prerender/tree/main/actions/pdp-renderer/templates) - more info [here](/docs/CUSTOMIZE.md)
  1. Deploy the solution with `aio app deploy`
